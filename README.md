# Suit-the-job
This is a project for "Data Mining & Machine Learning" exam of my Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence & Data Engineering master degree at University of Pisa.
The aim of the project is to build a resume classification model using a Linkedin
dataset obtained from Kaggle.
This task evolves into a more vertical job market analysis, focusing primarily on the “Data Science” field, which is of particular interest.
For this reason, a specific job posting dataset provided by Kaggle is used.
After some data preprocessing and EDA, a job recommender is built, based just on the cosine similarity between TF-IDF vectors previously calculated from resumes and job offers.
